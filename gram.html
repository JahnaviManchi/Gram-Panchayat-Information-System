Traditionally panchayats consisted of wise and respected elders chosen and accepted by the local community. However, there were varying forms of such assemblies.

Traditionally, these assemblies settled disputes between individuals and between villages.<br/></br>Mahatma Gandhi advocated panchayat raj as the foundation of India's political system. It would have been a decentralised form of government where each village would be responsible for its own affairs.The term for such a vision was Gram Swaraj ("village self-governance"). Instead India developed a highly centralised form of government.However, this has been moderated by the decentralisation of several administrative functions to the local level, empowering elected gram panchayats.There are significant differences between the traditional panchayati raj system, that envisioned Gandhi, and the system formalised in India in 1992.</p></td>
